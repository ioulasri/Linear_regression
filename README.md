# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Linear Regression Model** to predict car prices based on mileage. The dataset consists of **250 data points**, each including:
- 📍 **Mileage** (formatted as `xx,xxx km`)
- 💰 **Price** (in dollars)

The project involves **data preprocessing, feature scaling, training a regression model using gradient descent, and performance evaluation**.

---
## ✨ Features
✅ **Data Preprocessing:** Stripping `km` from mileage, removing commas, and converting to integers.  
✅ **Feature Scaling:** Min-Max normalization for mileage and price.  
✅ **Model Training:** Gradient Descent for optimizing **m (slope)** and **b (intercept)**.  
✅ **Performance Evaluation:** Using **R² score** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.  
✅ **Visualization:** Scatter plot comparing **actual vs. predicted prices**.

## 📊 Dataset
📌 The dataset (`data.csv`) contains **250 car entries**.  
📌 Mileage values range from **10,000 km to 250,000 km**.  
📌 Prices are **correlated** with mileage but include some noise for realism.

## 📈 Results
- 📉 **R² Score:** `0.89` (~89% variance explained)  
- 📏 **MAE:** `$388` (average price prediction error)  
- 📊 **Visualizations:** Scatter plot showing actual vs. predicted prices.
